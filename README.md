Text-based game for Hercules<br />
<br />
Main Stories<br />

As a developer, I want to make at least five commits on GitHub with descriptive messages. <br /> 
 
As a user, I want an engaging story to be told using print() statements. <br /> 
 
As a user, I want Hercules (and each enemy), to have health, attack power, and a List of attack names saved in a Dictionary. <br />
 
As a user, I want the ability to select Hercules’ attack using a menu prompt. <br />
 
As a user, I want the foe’s attack to be chosen at random. <br />
 
As a user, I want the results of each attack to be logged in the terminal.  <br />
 
As a developer, I want to use an Attack() function that will terminate when Hercules or an enemy’s health reaches zero.  <br />
 
As a developer, I want my RunGame() function to call my other functions in a logical order that will determine game flow. <br />
 
As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function should do just one thing!
